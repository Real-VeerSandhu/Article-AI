[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://real-veersandhu-article-ai-app-ieo382.streamlitapp.com/)

The NLP summarizers were built such that the user can summarize relevant articles by inputting a search term or summarize a specific article by inputting a URL. The search query will output a list of articles and the top 3 will be summarized based on relevancy to the topic. For specific URLs, the article‚Äôs text will be extracted and sent to the summarization model based on the given complexity.
