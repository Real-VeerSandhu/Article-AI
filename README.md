# üìùArticle-AI
### A [web app](https://article-ai.herokuapp.com/) that collects article data from the web and summarizes information with extractive NLP

The NLP summarizers were built such that the user can summarize relevant articles by inputting a search term or summarize a specific article by inputting a URL. The search query will output a list of articles and the top 3 will be summarized based on relevancy to the topic. For specific URLs, the article‚Äôs text will be extracted and sent to the summarization model based on the given complexity.
